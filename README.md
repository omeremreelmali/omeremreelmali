### Hi there 👋

Who am I ?
An endless journey from computer programming to software engineering 
Although it was not a very good computer, I reached my first computer a little earlier than my peers. There are two main factors that increase my interest in computers. Blogs I've opened about Harry Potter and other topics and , as you can imagine, games I played with my friends. Using a few scripts such as html, css, javascript code snippets, it made me very happy to make my blog different from others. Actually, the journey started exactly at this point, but I wasn't aware of what I was doing. I decided to study computerized database in high school. I thought it would add more to me. Although having a vocational high school education gave me some difficulty, I lost a year and gained software engineering. Frankly, I cannot say that I have an interest in one topic. I am interested in web, mobile, artificial intelligence and similar topics, but for now, I focused on mobile application development.
